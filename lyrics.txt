she blew you kisses from the back seat as she pulled away
she sank into the leather like she just got off the stage
she threw her head back to the laugh track and the disarray

she had that cold cold steel hid like a viper in the hay
she walked so slow that noone noticed holsters on her legs
her eyes wore thunder like a zeus on someone’s judgement day

we know what you did, and what you deserve
we know that you hid, who you really were
we know we were kids, when you did your worst
we know and were comin for ya, comin for ya

she wore the bruises of a father heiling from his grave
her veins tattooed with hate for any man who’d do the same
she saw no dollars, saw no medal, saw no trophy case

she had that good behavior now that she turned off the lights
she had that good behavior not that she put up a fight
she had that good behavior now they argue wrong or right

we know what you did, and what you deserve
we know that you hid, who you really were
we know we were kids, when you did your worst
we know and were comin for ya, comin for ya
